# Jun Sik's Data Analytics Portfolio

### About Me

I am Jun Sik Kim, a senior at Dickinson College pursuing a double major in Quantitative Economics and Data Analytics with a Mathematics Minor, set to graduate in May 2025. My academic background has equipped me with strong analytical skills and technical proficiency in Python, SQL, and Tableau. I've applied these skills to various projects focusing on socioeconomic trends and data visualization.

My portfolio demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and interpret complex datasets to derive actionable insights. Diverse experiences, including internships in logistics and research, have enhanced my problem-solving and communication skills. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive decision-making and contribute to impactful projects. Thank you for exploring my work!

### [Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/junsikkim614/Customer-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis/tree/main "Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis")

##### This project analyzes customer purchasing patterns to classify and predict what products they are likely to buy based on demographic and behavioral factors. The dataset includes customer attributes such as age, gender, purchase history, and payment method, among others.

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning, Classification, Regression, Clustering, Association Rule Mining

**Key findings** : 
- Males are more likely to purchase clothing when discounts are applied, while females show less preference for discounts.
- Decision Tree Classification outperformed other classification methods in predicting clothing purchases using age, purchase amount, and review ratings.
- Decision Tree Regression was the most suitable regression model for predicting purchase categories based on demographic and purchasing attributes.
- K-means clustering revealed that customers' previous purchase amounts are related to their future purchases, suggesting that targeted marketing based on purchase history could be effective
