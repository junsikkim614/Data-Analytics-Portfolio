# Jun Sik's Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi. I'm Jun Sik, a current senior in Dickinson College with a May 2025 graduation date double majoring in Quantitative Economics and Data Analytics with a Mathematics Minor. In this page I've added several of the projects that I've done to showcase my data analytical skills in different languages such as Python and SQL as well as a Tableau dashboard project.

#### [Education Attainment and Home Ownership by Race](http://https://github.com/junsikkim614/Education-Attainment-and-Home-Ownership-by-Race "Education Attainment and Home Ownership by Race")
##### This project analyzes education attainment and home ownership trends across different racial groups in the United States. It uses data from various years, focusing on White, Black, and Hispanic populations. 
**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis

**Key findings** : 
- Educational attainment levels varied significantly among racial groups, with trends changing over time
- Home ownership percentages showed disparities between racial groups, with White households consistently having higher rates of home ownership compared to Black and Hispanic households
- The analysis covered multiple years, allowing for the observation of long-term trends in both education and home ownership

### [COVID Data Exploration in SQL Project](http://https://github.com/junsikkim614/Covid-Project-Data-Exploration "COVID Data Exploration in SQL Project") 
##### This project analyzes COVID-19 data, focusing on cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries and continents. It uses two main datasets: coviddeaths and covidvaccinations, performing various SQL queries to extract insights about the pandemic's impact and vaccination progress 
**Skills used:** SQL (MySQL), Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Joins, CTEs, Views, Window Functions 

**Key findings** : 
- The analysis provides insights into death rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress for different countries and continents.
- The project includes calculations of death percentages, infection rates relative to population, and tracking of vaccination progress over time.
- Global numbers are analyzed to show the overall trend of cases and deaths throughout the pandemic

### [COVID Project Tableau Dashboard](http://https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jun.sik.kim/viz/CovidDashboard_17273094831420/Dashboard1 "COVID Project Tableau Dashboard")
##### This project analyzes global COVID-19 data, focusing on infection rates, death counts, and population impact across different countries and continents. The analysis uses SQL queries to process the data, which is then visualized in a Tableau dashboard for easy interpretation.
 
**Skills used:** SQL (MySQL), Data Analysis, Tableau, Data Visualization

**Key findings** : 
- The project provides a global overview of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and infection rates.
- It highlights the countries and continents most affected by the pandemic in terms of total death count and infection rates.
- The analysis includes time-series data to show the progression of infection rates across different locations.
